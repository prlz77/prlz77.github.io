Deep learning models are becoming increasingly bigger and deeper, becoming state of the art in numerous tasks. But how is it possible to grow these neural net architectures while preventing them from completely memorizing the training data, and showing good performances on unseen examples (overfitting)? The answer to this question includes multiple factors such as having bigger datasets, clever architectures, and good regularization methods. In our work, we focus on the latter, showing that there still is the need to explore new regularizers and the exact effects they have on the models. 

Concretely, we focus on *feature decorrelation*, a regularization strategy which was recently revitalized by [Cogswell et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06068) at ICLR2016
