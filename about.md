I am Pau Rodr√≠guez, an intern at Element AI, and PhD student at the Computer Vision Center (CVC) in the
Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). My research focuses on bio-inspired
machine learning techniques such as deep learning and their application to
computer vision and social media. I am an Artificial Intelligence enthusiast but
I also enjoy constantly learning new things ranging from science to literature.

Before, I finished a master of Artificial Intelligence at KU Leuven in 2015 and a 5-year degree on computer engineering at UAB. I have also done several internships in the university and in Visual Tagging Services, a computer vision start-up in the CVC.
