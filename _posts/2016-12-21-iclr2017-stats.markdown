Machine learning is accelerating, we have an idea and it is on arxiv the next
day, NIPS2016 was bigger than ever and it is difficult to keep track of all the
new interesting work.

Given that this is the first time I submit to ICLR, and taking advantage from
all the data available of OpenReview, I have decided to make some data
visualizations. I hope these visualizations help to build a mental idea of which
papers are the best rated, the ones with better reviews, who is submitting them,
which is the score distribution, etc.
