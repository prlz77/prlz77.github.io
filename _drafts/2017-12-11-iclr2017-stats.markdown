**TL;DR** We propose to locally decorrelate the feature weights of CNNs. When
the proposed method, which we call *OrthoReg*, is used to regularize the 40
layers of Wide Residual Networks, obtaining state of the art results on CIFAR,
and SVHN.

Deep learning models are becoming increasingly bigger and deeper, beating the
state of the art in numerous tasks. But how is it possible to grow these neural
net architectures while preventing them from completely memorizing the training
data and showing good performances on unseen examples (overfitting)? The answer to
this question includes multiple factors such as having bigger datasets, clever
architectures, and good regularization methods. Our work is centered on the
latter. Concretely, we focus on those regularization methods that prevent the
co-adaptation of feature detectors, thus reducing the redundancy in the models
and increasing their generalization power.

Probably, the most popular way to prevent feature co-adaptation is
[Dropout](https://github.com/szagoruyko/wide-residual-networks). However,
dropping techniques such as Dropout or DropConnect reduce the capacity of the
models, which need to be bigger to compensate for this fact. A least common way of preventing co-adaptation is to
add a regularization term to the loss function of the model so as to penalize
the correlation between neurons.  


Concretely, we focus on *feature decorrelation*, a regularization strategy which was recently revitalized by [Cogswell et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06068) at ICLR2016
