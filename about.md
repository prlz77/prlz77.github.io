I am Pau Rodr√≠guez, a Research Scientist at Element AI / ServiceNow. I am also an 
adjunct professor at Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona and an ELLIS member. 
My research focuses on how to make artificial intelligence resemble more to natural intelligence.
I am particularly interested in algorithms that learn from few samples or that require
fewer annotations. Some of the topics I am interested in are representation learning, 
unsupervised learning, and few-shot learning.   
I am an Artificial Intelligence enthusiast but I also enjoy constantly learning new 
things ranging from science to literature.

Before joining Element AI, I studied a PhD on Computer Vision and Deep Learning at the Computer
Vision Center, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona. I finished a master of Artificial Intelligence 
at KU Leuven in 2015 and a 5-year degree on computer engineering at UAB. I have also done several 
internships at Element AI,  UAB, and Visual Tagging Services, a computer vision start-up in the CVC.
