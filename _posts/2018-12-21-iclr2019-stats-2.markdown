Decisions for ICLR2019 are out! So it is time to take a look at this year's
trends! Which researches have been most successful? Which institutions? Which
papers?

[(Link to part 1)](https://github.com/prlz77/iclr2019-stats)

<!---->

This year, 24 **oral** papers have been accepted, **476** posters, and 918
**rejects**. This is, 500 of 1418 papers have been accepted, and thus reaching an
acceptance rate of 35.26%.

This is the updated table with all papers and decisions:

<script>
    $(document).ready(function() {
        $.getJSON('{{ "/assets/js/iclr2019/iclr2019.json" | absolute_url }}', function (table_data) {
            $('#iclr2019').DataTable({
                data: table_data,
                columns: [
                    {title: "Title", className: "dt-body-nowrap"},
                    {title: "Min score", className: "dt-center"},
                    {title: "Max Score", className: "dt-center"},
                    {title: "Mean Score", className: "dt-center"},

                    {title: "Decision", className: "dt-center"},
                ],
                "order": [[6, "asc"], [3, "desc"]]
            });
        });
    });

Let's now see which have been the most prolific institutions.

## Top prolific institutions
<figure style="height:400px; overflow:scroll;">
    <embed type="image/svg+xml" src='{{
    "/assets/images/iclr2019/affiliations.svg" | absolute_url }}' />
</figure>

The top institutions haven't changed much since the [last
edition](https://prlz77.github.io/iclr2018-stats-3/), in fact, most of the top
prolific institutions have grown even more in the number of submissions this
year. In the following graph, I
have plotted the difference between 2019 and 2018.

<figure style="height:400px; overflow:scroll;">
    <embed type="image/svg+xml" src='{{
    "/assets/images/iclr2019/affiliations_delta.svg" | absolute_url }}' />
</figure>
<br>
Notice that the number of rejections usually grows with the number of accepted
works.

## Top prolific authors
Here is the list of the top (co)authors.

    "/assets/images/iclr2019/authors.svg" | absolute_url }}' />
</figure>

<br>
Differently from last year, Sergey Levine has surpassed Yoshua Bengio, although
Yoshua appears in an oral paper. Anyway congratulations to all authors in the
graph. I would also like to mention that many first-authors do not appear
in this figure, since they spent most of their effort in a single submission.

So, what is the secret sauce? What should I put into my paper to get accepted?
Here are the keywords most related to the different final decisions:

So let's work on **Theory** about **robust graph neural networks** for **domain
adaptation**!!!!

## Collaboration between institutions

In the last edition, we noticed that the most prolific institutions where those
with more collaborations. How about this year?

<div id="interactions" style="text-align:center;">
</div>

So the trend continues, google, microsoft, mit, cmu, berkeley, are the ones that
collaborate more with others.
<br>

## Collaboration between top authors
Let's see how authors collaborate. This time I will use a graph to see if people
forms clusters.

<div id="mynetwork" style="width:100%; height:600px;" ></div>

Effectively, some clusters can be seen. For instance, the MILA group is
represented by the connections between Yoshua, Aaron, and Ioannis. There is also
the Berkeley group with Chelsea Finn, Sergey Levine, Pieter Abeel, et al. Deepmind
is represented by the region with Oriol Vinyals, Tim Lillicrap, Nando de
Freitas... Interestingly, there is an isolated group formed by MSR researchers,
with Tienyan Liu, Tao Qin, and Wei Chen.
