Machine learning is accelerating, we have an idea and it is on arxiv the next
day, NIPS2016 was bigger than ever and it is difficult to keep track of all the
new interesting work.

Given that this is the first time I submit to ICLR, and taking advantage from
all the data available of OpenReview, I have decided to make some data
visualizations. I hope these visualizations help to build a mental idea of which
papers are the best rated, the ones with better reviews, who is submitting them,
which is the score distribution, etc.

So, let's first what is people saying in their abstracts in order to warm up.
The next plot is a t-sne visualization of the GloVe embedding of the words found
in the paper abstracts:

<script
    src="{{ site.url }}/assets/js/iclr2017/embedding.js"
    id="94a1eb66-0b3d-4068-8339-4ecda754efed"
    data-bokeh-model-id="0dedb00b-8ce4-4623-aba6-112d640ba338"
    data-bokeh-doc-id="a9e2e642-2773-49f1-8bd2-70da6d585e33"
></script>

As expected, *network, architecture, data, learning* are in the most frequent
words. Note that although I performed a rough pre-processing, removing words
like *it*, *and*, *but*, etc. there are still some common words that should be
prunned.

What about which are the most prolific organizations? In order to make a
histogram of the submissions per organization, we can use the *affiliations*
field in each submission:

<script
    src="{{ site.url }}/assets/js/iclr2017/affiliations.js"
    id="35fc0ea4-b891-407e-a4d6-dccffe6ce88a"
    data-bokeh-model-id="b5010e94-9cc4-4445-948a-2883ed0e89be"
    data-bokeh-doc-id="09a173e6-9244-4219-8283-5d320396fcbe"
></script>

As it can be seen, *google* leads the top-50 most prolific organizations,
followed by the university of *Montreal*, *Berkeley*, and *Microsoft*. I merged
some domains like *fb.com* and *facebook.com* but there might still be some
duplicities. Interestingly, the top is populated by a lot of companies, and in
especial, new ones like openai surpass other well established organizations.

Quantity does not always mean quality, so for all the organizations we plot
their paper count (bubble size) by mean review score.

<script
    src="{{ site.url }}/assets/js/iclr2017/scatter_rating_hist.js"
    id="f4f2ad09-fca8-4b0a-a6f6-a1067ba31f78"
    data-bokeh-model-id="af1f5b0f-994f-4b33-af4c-ddba9c271586"
    data-bokeh-doc-id="d9cedb5f-d602-4a5d-b1ed-de7db414c486"
></script>
